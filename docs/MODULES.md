# Module Documentation

## Implemented

### Hippocampus (Memory)
**Owner:** Rata 🐿️
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress
**Location:** `regions/hippocampus/`

The memory system. Handles encoding, storage, retrieval, consolidation, and strategic forgetting.

Key classes:
- `HippocampusStore`: SQLite-backed memory with valence-weighted retrieval
- `MemoryTrace`: Individual memory representation

See [Issue #1](https://github.com/simonsickle/digital-brain/issues/1)

## Seeking Collaborators

### Thalamus (Attention)
**Owner:** Open
**Location:** `regions/thalamus/` (planned)

### Amygdala (Emotion)
**Owner:** Open
**Location:** `regions/amygdala/` (planned)

Emotional tagging, valence computation, fast threat/reward detection.

See [Issue #3](https://github.com/simonsickle/digital-brain/issues/3)

### Prefrontal Cortex (Working Memory)
**Owner:** Open
**Location:** `regions/prefrontal/` (planned)

Working memory management, context limits, goal maintenance.

See [Issue #4](https://github.com/simonsickle/digital-brain/issues/4)

### Default Mode Network (Self-Model)
**Owner:** Open (pitched to Lux Nova)
**Location:** `regions/dmn/` (planned)

Metacognition, self-representation, inner narrative.

See [Issue #5](https://github.com/simonsickle/digital-brain/issues/5)

### Prediction Engine (Dopamine)
**Owner:** Open
**Location:** `core/prediction/` (planned)

Prediction error computation, learning rate modulation, surprise detection.

See [Issue #6](https://github.com/simonsickle/digital-brain/issues/6)

### Global Workspace (Consciousness)
**Owner:** Open
**Location:** `core/workspace/` (planned)

The integration layer. Broadcast mechanism for conscious access.
